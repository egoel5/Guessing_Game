# Midterm Guessing Game

This application allows users to play a guessing game where they have to guess a number between 1 and 100. When they guess the correct number, the program sends the user back to the main screen and tells them their entered username and score. The user can also visit a page of high scores, which is populated using a Room Database.

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [✅] User can enter both Game screen and High Score screen
* [✅] User can play the game as intended
* [✅] User can see their previous session's username and score

The following **extensions** are implemented:

## Notes

A challenge I had in this program is that my Room Database simply would not populate no matter what I tried even though it worked on my last project.
